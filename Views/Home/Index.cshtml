<p class="fw-bold">Please feel free to register either as a client, seller, or admin to explore the different features and functionalities that
    come with each of the different roles. 
</p>

<h4 class="display-6">Please read below</h4>
<hr>

<p>As a client, you can view products, add them to your cart, and place an order. As a seller, you can add products, view orders, 
    and manage your products. As an admin, you can view all orders, manage products, and manage users.</p>
    
<p>In your POE I should be able to do the same. If you cannot implement the user management
    functionality, make sure that i am able to CRUD and explore the features of each role freely.</p>

<p>This is a proof of concept and still does not include every single feature and functionality under the sun but it should give you an idea of what is required from you</p>
<p>It goes without saying that if you try to repackage this exact project and submit it as part of your POE that you will be flagged for copying and cheating and face disciplinary action.
    Use this example to extend what you have already built
